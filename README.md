# Diffusion-limited Aggregation
"Diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) is a growth process of clusters of aggregated particles driven by their random diffusion.

There are two types of particles, like in Schelling’s segregation model, but only one of them can move freely. The movable particles diffuse in a
2-D space by random walk, while the immovable particles do nothing; they just remain where they are. If a movable particle “collides” with an immovable particle (i.e., if they come close enough to each other), the movable particle becomes immovable and stays there forever. This is the only rule for the agents’ interaction."
